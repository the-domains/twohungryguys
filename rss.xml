            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About Us</h1><p>Two friends, two years planning and two very hungry guys. We have always loved the extraordinary ordinary life. Going into supermarkets and buying 'regular 'off the shelf' food is slowly becoming 'old hat' for us; as we begin to follow a life long dream of raising our own livestock, open reared and living the way we want them to live. So, one Geordie who loves farming and one Greek Cypriot who loves cooking. A perfect combination!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/63c93866ff8b4642cf9a0bc37a3239383d9554b1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

So the way that we are selling the pork is in four ways; whole, half, quarter or family packs.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3868694b2c5ad63534742d1bb88ad136c86125b7.png"></article>]]></description>
