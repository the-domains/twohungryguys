We saw the pigs every day and gave them lots of care; brushing them with a stiff brush and making sure that they were running around.

Cleaning the living area was always on the diary, making sure that they were clean and had straw to sleep on.

Every day they were fed a high protein feed, which we mixed with barley for the first stage of their growth. We then replaced the barley with high vegetables and fruit so that the meat to fat ratio would enhance the marble lines in the meat. Yum!
