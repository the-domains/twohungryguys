We have had some amazing laughs and struggles raising the pigs. They have escaped through the fence, knocked us over, and even given us a visit to the hospital for a back pull...

Overall, worth every bit of effort to get to a stage where we can enjoy the open reared pork and gammon that they are raised for.

So how long until they are ready. Here is the deal. Two of the pigs are spoken for, two hungry guys, right? However, that does mean that we have three beautiful pigs to offer to you.
