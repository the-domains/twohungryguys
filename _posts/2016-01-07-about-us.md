Two friends, two years planning and two very hungry guys. We have always loved the extraordinary ordinary life. Going into supermarkets and buying 'regular 'off the shelf' food is slowly becoming 'old hat' for us; as we begin to follow a life long dream of raising our own livestock, organic and living the way we want them to live.

So, one Geordie Toyota after care sales manager, who loves farming and one Greek Cypriot leadership trainer who loves cooking. A perfect combination!
