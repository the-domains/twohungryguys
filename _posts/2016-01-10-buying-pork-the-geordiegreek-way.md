We want to keep things simple, after all life is too complex. So the way that we are selling the pork is in four ways; **whole**, **half**, **quarter** or **family packs**.

This way you are certain that you are receiving the best meat and sections of pork ready for your BBQs, sausages, gammons or crispy bacon.

All the pork will be sectioned into packs, so all you need to do is tell us where you live and in which freezer you need us to put your pork into. It is that simple!
