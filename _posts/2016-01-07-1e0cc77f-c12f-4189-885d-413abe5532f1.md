We bought 5 little Saddlebacks on July 12th and had them moved to the nNorth WEast to their new home with a 1/4 of acre of land for them to 'rut' in and a brick shelter to live in. Their bedding was laid with straw and we often had our children come and help create the right fun and care for the 5 pigs. Yes they were named! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ab6d30f2-ebd2-457b-938d-c70f8d5e8935.JPG)
