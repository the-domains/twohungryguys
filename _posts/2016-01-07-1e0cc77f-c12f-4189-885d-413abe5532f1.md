We bought 5 little Saddlebacks on 12th July, had them moved to the North East of England to their new home. Situated on a 1/4 of acre of land in the semi rural town of Burnofield, they have plenty of room to 'rut' around. At night they are able to enter a massive brick shelter to live in. Their bedding laid with straw and we often have our children come and help care for the  pigs. Yes they were all named! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/12aff5e8-184e-4b61-8bee-81264d67908f.JPG)

We think that great pork meat is not just about size but it is also down to how you treat them. We are absolutely passionate about raising these guys as happily as...well....our own children.
