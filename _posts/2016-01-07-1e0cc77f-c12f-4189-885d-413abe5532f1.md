We bought 5 little Saddlebacks on 12th July, had them moved to the North East of England to their new home. Situated on a 1/4 of acre of land in the semi rural town of Burnofield, they have plenty of room to 'rut' around. At night they are able to enter a massive brick shelter to live in. Their bedding laid with straw and we often have our children come and help care for the  pigs. Yes they were all named! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ab6d30f2-ebd2-457b-938d-c70f8d5e8935.JPG)
